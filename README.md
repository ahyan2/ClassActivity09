This program allows the user to create a Movie object, containing attributes such as a movie title, nested Date object (day/month/year), popularity boolean, director name, and decimal rating. The program verifies user input every step of the way, ensuring sensible inputs are given. Additionally, it uses an overloaded stream insertion operator to properly display the Movie and Date objects given by the user.
